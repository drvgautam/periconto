https://www.solventis.net/products/ketones/methyl-iso-butyl-ketone/,"Methyl iso butyl ketone (also known as MIBK, methyl isobutyl ketone, and mono-iso butyl ketone) is a clear, colourless liquid with a characteristic ketone odour.  It has the chemical formula C6H12 and is slightly soluble in water and is miscible with most organic solvents. There are two main routes for MIBK production.  In the first, MIBK is produced from isopropanol in a mixed ketones process.  Di isobutyl ketone (DIBK) and acetone are co-products of this process.  In the second, MIBK is produced from acetone with hydrogen by a 3 step process of aldol condensation, dehydration, and hydrogenation. At present, the global production capacity for MIBK stands at 370,000 tonnes per year. MIBK is stored in drums and/or in bulk tanks and is transported by tank trucks.  It has a specific gravity of 0.802 and a low flash point of 16° C (closed cup) which makes it highly flammable.  It should, therefore, be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area that is free from the risk of ignition.  For transportation purposes, MIBK is classified as packing group II, hazard class 3, and is an irritant. MIBK is an excellent solvent and 64 % of the total global MIBK produced is consumed in this way.  It is primarily used as a solvent in cellulose-based and resin-based coatings and adhesives.  It is also an extraction solvent for antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, and is employed in rare-metal extraction as a solvent for metal separation. MIBK is also a chemical intermediate that is used to produce target molecules such as rubber antiozonants (used in the production of tyres) and acetylenic diol compounds.",What is Methyl Iso Butyl Ketone?

https://www.byk-instruments.com/en/raw-material-titanium-dioxide,"""The first step is always the hardest."" This also applies when formulating a coating. The application of the final finish determines the selection of the raw materials. Not only are mechanical properties like abrasion resistance and adhesion important, but also optical attributes like color, gloss and opacity; and one cannot forget the overall costs of the formulation. In order to guarantee consistent quality a routine quality control system needs to be established at the very first production step. Paint is a liquid or powdery coating that is applied on objects as a very thin layer. By means of chemical or physical processes, it converts to an adherent film. Paint normally consists of the following components: Pigments Binder, Fillersm Additives, Solvents / Water (not in powder coatings)
Titanium dioxide is the brightest, whitest pigment available. Due to its high refractive index (even higher than diamond) it effectively scatters the light and provides maximum opacity for a coating. Rutile is the most common natural form of TiO2 and preferred over anatase because of the lower photocatalytic activities and thus, better weather stability of the final coating.
The purity of TiO2 is process related. The chloride process makes up purer and brighter grades than the sulfate process. Additionally, impurities introduced by treatment chemicals or extraneous metal ions within the crystallites can degrade brightness. They usually discolor the pigment towards grey or yellow. 
One way to perform a color measurement is to incorporate the TiO2 pigment into the coatings system of the final application. To ensure a smooth and homogeneous surface, the paint is applied to opacity drawdown charts with an automatic film applicator. The charts are made of black and white areas that are large enough to be measured with color instruments. An alternative is to take readings on dry pressed pucks. The pucks are made by applying high pressure to the dry TiO2 which is contained by a ring. The pressure is essential as it is the driving force to compact the pigment and hold it together for measurement. The face of the puck is then measured with a spectrophotometer.
The standardized CIE colorimetric values L* and b* are used to characterize brightness and undertone: the higher the L* value, the higher the brightness, the lower the b* value, the less yellow the appearance. In the table below, results for different grades of TiO2 are displayed. The spectro2guide can be used to measure CIELab color numbers. The instrument stores and directly transfers measurement data to smart-chart data analysis Software. 
Besides brightness and undertone, optimum hiding power and tinting strength are properties that the TiO2 pigment has to meet. Gloss and haze level of a TiO2 pigment is mainly controlled by the primary particle size and the number of particles with a diameter larger than 0.5 μm. To achieve glossy finishes with improved distinctness of image, oversized particles have to be minimized. The haze-gloss is an objective tool to measure matte to high-gloss surfaces by offering three gloss geometries (20°, 60°, 85°) as well as reflectance haze measurement in one unit. However, to measure gloss and haze the TiO2 has to be incorporated in the coatings system and a drawdown has to be made.
During the dispersion process, the pigments are dispersed into small particles: the smaller the particles, the smoother the surface. The graph above shows the influence of degree of dispersion on gloss and haze. Pigment particles that are smaller than 10 μm show a tremendous reduction in haze and a slight increase in gloss, resulting in a glossy finish with improved imaging forming qualities.
 Organic and inorganic absorption pigments selectively absorb and scatter the incident light. Besides the color itself, tinting strength is one of the most important properties that need to be controlled. Tinting strength is directly influenced by the pigment type and concentration used in the coating system.","Color, Gloss and Haze Analysis of TiO2"

https://feltmagnet.com/painting/Fillers-and-Pigment-Extenders-for-Paints,"So what are fillers and pigment extenders? Why are they used in paint? There are two main reasons why these kinds of materials are used in paint. One is for economical reasons because pigments are very expensive. The second reason is more important: Many fillers and extenders improve the performance and handling of the paint while being applied. Most fillers and pigment extenders are white or colorless powders. Many are naturally occurring minerals with widespread occurrence. Usually, though, the mined minerals need to go through processing to remove impurities. Others are synthetic to produce a product ready for paint formulation. Calcium carbonate (whiting, chalk, drop chalk, or limestone) is a white powdery substance. It is a simple compound of the element calcium bonded to carbonate. It occurs naturally as marble and natural chalk. It is mostly made synthetic since it’s very inexpensive to precipit It is mainly used as a filler in paints to extend pigments. I find calcium carbonate quite satisfactory when used to extend pigments when preparing dispersions. It lightens the color a bit but is translucent, especially in solvent-based paints, which means adding it to another color will not instantly turn them into pastels. It is also used to prepare “French Mineral“ pigment. These are basically organic pigments mechanically bonded to a calcium carbonate base. This combination is much easier to disperse in water-based paint mediums.
Another use of calcium carbonate is to make painting grounds for canvases and hard board panels used for artists' paintings. Gesso is essentially chalk in an acrylic or vinyl binder that prepares porous surfaces to be painted on with acrylic and oil paints.
Calcium carbonate is used to make chalk paint for application on porous substrates like wood. Adding calcium carbonate to latex or acrylic paint makes the paint gritty and textured. It lends itself well to decorative distressing and chalk paint does not need a primer to be applied.ate a calcium chloride solution with a sodium carbonate solution. Mixing both clear solutions forms calcium carbonate in a finely divided form. Talc is a naturally occurring mineral composed of magnesium silicate. It is often refined to a bright white powder and is used as a thickener, lubricant, and as filler in paint and two-part epoxy resin. In paint, talc adds texture and body to the paint vehicle. Also, talc is often used to make universal tints and pigment dispersions. Its unique structure can aid in the dispersion of organic pigments.
Like calcium carbonate mentioned above, talc is also useful for making grounds. Kaolin clay is a white clay that is used to make porcelain, chinaware, and even toilets. Like all fillers mentioned thus far, kaolin can be used as a painting ground. It can also be ground with organic pigments to make inexpensive paint colorants that are easier to disperse in water-based media.
Kaolin not only extends pigments, but for latex paints, it also contributes to a harder paint film with improved adhesion. Barium sulfate, also referred to by its natural mineral form barite, is a dense white powder. It is mainly used as a pigment in coatings. In oil-based paint, it is nearly transparent and used as a filler and extender and to modify consistency. Titanium white, by itself, is an unsatisfactory white pigment for oil paints due to the spongy film it forms. A mix of titanium white and barium sulfate fixes this and is referred to as permanent white. When barium sulfate is combined with zinc sulfide, it’s referred to as lithopone. Aluminum stearate is a white powdery compound that is a metal salt of a fatty acid. It's often referred to as an aluminum soap. Aluminum stearate is added to oil paints to stabilize the dispersion of pigments and to give the paint body as well. When a high enough concentration is added to a drying oil, aluminum stearate can cause it to thicken and gel. This is the same process as making napalm from petrol.Not only can aluminum stearate thicken drying oils, but it can also assist in the dispersion of pigments into the oil. The stearate is allowed to coat the pigment particles, therefore preventing agglomeration of the pigment particle. Some oil, like linseed oil, can be heated and a 2% solution of aluminum stearate can be created to add to the pigment prior to grinding. Alternatively, the correct amount of aluminum stearate can be added to the pigment and ground together in a mortar and pestle prior to mulling on the slab with drying oil. Diatomaceous earth—DE, or Kieselgur—is a silica-containing sedimentary rock. It is mainly used as a filtration medium in water purification. It also finds applications in the concrete, pesticide, and explosive industries. It is formed from fossilized exoskeletons of diatoms.
Diatomaceous earth is lightweight and porous and has several properties beneficial to paints. One is that diatomaceous earth is amorphous silica and not crystalline silica. This mitigates the health risk associated with crystalline silica. Diatomaceous earth lends durability and hardness to a paint film and therefore less resin is required. Also, due to its unique porous structure, diatomaceous earth speeds up the drying of paint film. Diatomaceous earth is useful as a matting agent when a less glossy finish is desired. Wollastonite is a mineral consisting mainly of calcium metasilicate. It is a white to off-white powder often used in ceramics because it acts like a flux and is also an additive to reduce shrinking of clays during firing. This last use is attributed to wollastonite’s lack of moisture and other volatile components. It also has applications in the concrete and coating industries.Its main use for paints and coatings is attributed to its high whiteness, high alkaline pH, and its ability to enhance the durability of coatings. The alkaline pH of 10 is especially favorable to the formulation of water-borne emulsion paints. Alkalinity stabilizes emulsions and helps reduce rusting of iron and steel substrates. This alkalinity also means less ammonia is needed reducing the odor of the emulsion paints. Nephelene Syenite is a silica-deficient sodium aluminosilicate mineral filler. It is essentially free of crystalline silica and is being sought after by the coating industry because of this property. The particles are an angular platelet type that easily interlock and have low overall surface area. With the hardness of nephelene and the interlocking particles, this filler adds durability and scuff resistance to coatings. The low surface area makes for easy dispersions in any paint medium. The alkaline nature of this mineral is beneficial for stability in water-based coatings as already noted for wollastonite.

https://www.corrosionpedia.com/2/1823/industries/transportation/aviation-coatings-for-corrosion-prevention,"Aero engines and other parts of aircraft are designed on the principle of a very high power-to-weight ratio, and hence each of the parts is expected to ensure the highest performance for a profitable long-term operation of the asset.
Corrosive deterioration of the critical surfaces of the aircraft can come in the way of ensuring reliable and safe operational performance. If the corrosion is not detected and prevented in time, it can endanger human lives.
The coating systems needed for corrosion protection of these exposed surfaces of the aircraft must be selected carefully to match the challenges of the hostile environment in which the aircraft operates. The coating must be applied with great care to ensure a productive longevity of the aircraft. Aircraft maintenance engineers and designers need to minimize the metal losses by looking for optimum solutions. The major contributors to the corrosive deterioration of the aircraft are hostile environmental factors and climatic conditions. Airplanes operating in polluted industrial environments as well as in saline coastal climate conditions are susceptible to severe corrosion of the exposed surfaces. Water vapor, either alone or in combination with acidic constituents—such as salts present in a marine environment or fumes and pollutant particles from industries—can initiate electrochemical reactions on the metallic surfaces of the aircraft, leading to the corrosive deterioration of surfaces.
Aircraft manufacturers design airplanes to prevent corrosion through the careful selection of structural materials and coatings, as well as the provision of water drainages, moisture sealants, and chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors. A planned corrosion-control program is necessary for the complete service life of the airplane. For more on this subject, be sure to read Corrosion Knowledge Management versus Corrosion Management: An Essential Tool for Assets Integrity Management.) On an aircraft surface, corrosion can appear in various forms. The most common is crevice corrosion, occurring wherever moisture is entrenched in between two proximate surfaces. Under certain conditions, it can gradually form pitting or exfoliation corrosion.
Crevice corrosion can accelerate quickly and results from environmental catalysts present at the metallic surfaces. It can take the form of oxygen differential cell corrosion. The entrapped moisture in the crevice contains less oxygen when it is in a crevice than when it is on an open surface. The lower oxygen content creates an anode at the surface, and the open-air metal surface forms a cathode. Contaminants create acidic ions such as chloride ions, which migrate to the anode to create a corrosive condition. An effective sealing of joints is the best way to eliminate this form of corrosion.Other dangerous forms include stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and exfoliation corrosion. Both forms occur rapidly and become destructive by following the grain boundaries of alloys of aluminum. Exfoliation occurs in different planes, with the leaf-shaped separation of the grain structure. Both of these corrosion forms affect the structural integrity, which in turn affects the load-carrying capability and other mechanical parameters. These forms need to be controlled at the design stage by keeping stresses low and selecting a suitable grain structure of the metal alloys. Pitting corrosion can often lead to fatigue failures in critical areas.General corrosion consumes material at a uniform rate. Initially the risk is low, but it can affect the structure over a period of time if unattended. Complete maintenance is needed, as well as the repair coating of affected surfaces. Galvanic corrosion takes place due to the electrical connection of two metals of different galvanic electrode potentials within the area of an electrolyte. This can take place at the joint of an aluminum-bronze bushing used in an aluminum alloy or even inside the aluminum alloy particles because of potential difference between aluminum and copper layers. (Related reading: The Corrosion Properties of Aluminum and Its Alloys.) Proper planning at the design verification and review stage for effective corrosion control must be based on the comprehensive consideration of engineering performance requirements and operational environments. (Learn more about the importance of a good upfront design in How to Control Corrosion by Improving Design.) The requirements need to be matched by a prudent material selection, coating and surface finish selection, moisture drainage, use of joint sealants, selection of corrosion-inhibiting chemicals, access for inspection and maintenance, effective corrosion prevention and corrective action plans in service, and the consideration of regulatory issues.
The selection of appropriate metal alloys is essential for ensuring long-term corrosion prevention and control. Aluminum is the automatic choice for most of the aircraft structures and components/parts. Along with aluminum alloys, steel and its alloys are also used in aircraft, both being highly prone to attacks of corrosion.Corrosion prevention in this case involves cleaning the surfaces and providing a surface finish through layers of coatings. For the surfaces of aluminum alloys, the coating of a corrosion-inhibiting primer is the first coat. For the low-alloy steel components, the surface coating consists of a thin cadmium plating and a chemical corrosion inhibitor primer.Stainless steel components are also cadmium-plated and primed as in the case of alloy steel components, as they may be connected to aluminum parts. A primer is used on titanium components too. Corrosion-inhibitor primers are required to be hydraulic fluid-resistant (Skydrol® for example) polyurethanes and epoxies.The moisture from a pressurized fuselage is required to be drained by drain holes with valves. Fluids are also required to flow in the direction of drain holes through a system of drain paths.Crevice corrosion at joints is minimized by sealing the gaps on the joint surfaces with a polysulfide sealant. The sealant is used in skin-to-stringer as well as skin-to-shear types of joints in the fuselage, areas of skin doublers, chord-to-skin joints for the wing and wheel structure, etc. In cases of severe proneness to corrosion, such as electrical bonds and antenna peripheries, fillet seals are used.As the aircraft structures are built from different metals, they can suffer deterioration of the surface due to metals reacting to the environment. The electrochemical process of corrosion can begin even during the process of manufacturing and temporary storage. Even from the moment the airplane is delivered by the seller, it must be thoroughly inspected and preserved as well as protected from the corrosive environment in which it has to operate.This protection needs to be considered right at the design and component material selection stage. By adding certain constituents to metallic substances, we can enhance the corrosion resistance of the system. Surface coatings used for the aircraft and the components will also protect the aircraft.The airframe, made up of metals as well as non-metallic composites, also require regular inspection for monitoring of aircraft from the perspective of corrosion. Even though the airframe may not become corroded directly, the metallic accessories and components attached to the airframe could be subjected to deterioration. Corrosion is the surface deterioration of metal due to electrochemical or chemical reactions occurring on the surfaces. These kinds of reactions can occur internally too. Water present in the environment can be deposited on the surface and the metal particles will combine with the oxygen dissolved in the water, with impurities acting as an electrolyte. Acidic particles present in the environment can cause chemical corrosion by reacting directly with the metal at a rapid rate.Inspections must be performed regularly to detect and recognize the signs of corrosion on the aircraft's surfaces. Inspection checklists are comprehensive as they cover every part and surface. Based on the peculiarity of the aircraft model, some special areas need to be critically examined.For reciprocating engines as well as jet engines, the following areas need detailed examination:The exhaust area, Exhaust pipes and nozzles Rivet heads and crevices nearby These are affected because exhaust emissions lead to corrosive deposits. The deposits could be trapped deep inside and are not easily cleaned. These may have sumps of dirty water, floating oils, used hydraulic fluids and debris, and used oils that necessarily contain water settling slowly at the bottom, which sets corrosion in motion. Inspection and regular maintenance of the coatings in this area must be undertaken. When planes operated from ships are repaired, the corrosion applicable to marine equipment should also be considered. The space under galleys and lavatories, as well as waste disposal openings at the exteriors of the aircraft, need to be carefully inspected, as the nature of waste products and chemicals in lavatories could lead to corrosion. The coating may need to be repaired frequently. The landing gear, as well as the wheel well area, suffers due to water, gravel, salt, chemicals, mud, dust and debris of various kinds. Surface coatings on these parts can’t be made foolproof. A thin preservative coating may only be masking a dangerous onset of corrosion.
During braking, heat generation can cause the cracking of anticorrosion preservative layers (if they are used on the surface). Different trouble spots must be inspected for entrapped water, rust, and abrasive wear. Typical debris traps and moisture traps—such as ribs, stiffener crevices, and lower skin areas—must be inspected. If the low-point drains are partially clogged by debris, water can accumulate and cause corrosive deterioration.
Cooling vents and the front surface areas of the engine get rubbed due to airborne sand, salt particles, and gritty dust from runways, as well as snow and rain, causing the erosion of protective coatings and the sporadic deposition of salt. Inspecting technicians should be able to highlight these occurrences as and when they are noticed.
In the case of helicopters, gearboxes and rotor heads—along with other bare surfaces—need to be inspected for evidence of corrosive failure. Additionally, all types of cables are prone to internal corrosion and external corrosion. The battery vent openings and compartments are known as the most corrosion-prone spaces of aircraft. Gases and fumes emanating from the heated electrolyte will naturally spread to the nearest cavities and coating holidays, and attack all the unprotected metal surfaces as well as crevices. Acids may get deposited in small quantities. Electrolytic cleaning or chemical cleaning of surfaces is resorted to before the surface finishing for corrosion protection. After polishing and buffing, the anodizing process is started. The sheet of aluminum alloy is connected as the positive pole in the bath of electrolytes (comprising chromic acid), which produces an aluminum oxide layer on the metallic surface. This process effectively increases the thickness of the protective aluminum oxide layer. This layer can be partially restored during annual maintenance servicing, through suitable surface treatments. The anodized layer provides effective resistance to corrosion. In addition, this film provides a strong bond for paint. After the anodizing process, aluminum surfaces are immediately primed and coated by approved paint. The aircraft engines continuously face severe challenges as the load-carrying parts are operated at higher and higher temperatures with enhanced velocities for an improved performance. Corrosion and other forms of metal loss reduce the component efficiency. Thermal sprays and cold sprays of various coatings help to minimize corrosion and other forms of metal loss. Barrier coating on components such as turbine blades has proved effective.
High technology coating processes, such as high velocity oxygen fuel spraying (HVOF) and plasma spray, are used for critical parts of the aircraft engines and other components. New barrier coatings for high temperature applications are being tried out.
Aircraft engine components from ceramic matrix composites are being developed by GE Aviation in collaboration with Turbocoating SPA of Parma, Italy. Coating manufacturers are offering platinum aluminides, based on proprietary vapor deposition processes, for aluminizing the components and surfaces used at extreme high temperatures. Ceramic coatings have superior properties when compared with organic coatings, in terms of better high-temperature corrosion resistance as well as erosion resistance.
Turbine blades of jet engines are made from nickel-based alloys and sometimes also use ceramic materials similar to zirconia. These blades are coated with a ceramic barrier coating for heat and corrosion protection.
Ceramic coatings offer excellent protection against exposure to high temperature cycles and salty environments. They combine good adhesion, thermal stability, hardness, and flexibility. Proprietary ceramic composite coating systems with corrosion protective organic topcoat sealers are being developed. Thermally-fused ceramic composite with an aluminum-rich organic top coat has the advantage of oxidation resistance even at high temperatures. Proprietary ceramic coatings specifically formulated for combustion chamber and valves, sea wind exhausts, and expansion chambers are used in large aircraft. Coatings used in military aircraft have to meet the stringent requirements of military standards. U.S. military standards for aviation coatings are referred to as MIL-PRF-85285E. Commercial aircraft coatings in the U.S. generally comply with AMS 3095 - SAE Standards (aerospace material specifications). Aircraft manufacturers also specify certification standards for the coatings to be applied. Boeing's requirements are prescribed in the standard BMS-10-83K. Urethane primer is formulated as a high-performance corrosion inhibitor for all types of aircraft. It has good intercoat adhesion. Some of the newer formulations are offered as chrome-free urethane primers, meeting the stringent regulatory requirements. These are free from hexavalent chromium. These may also help to prepare a substrate for top coatings; for good adhesion requirements working as sanding surfacers. Urethane consists of two parts, comprising the base and certain binders with catalysts. Its advantages are:
High durability, Chemical resistance, Abrasion resistance, High gloss finish. Urethane may contain isocyanides as activators; in which case, more care is needed in spraying. Certain proprietary formulations of urethane are exclusively formulated for interior coating with a soft texture. Advanced polyurethane primer as a chrome hazard-free formulation ensures very good corrosion resistance, along with a long pot life, making it suitable for coating a large aircraft. The film has higher flexibility and aviation hydraulic fluid resistance (Skydrol resistance). Polyurethane coatings are the most preferred coating in the aviation industry, due to advantages such as: High chemical resistance, Natural ultraviolet ray (sunlight) resistance, High abrasion resistance, High stain resistance, Directness of image (DOI) with high gloss retentionThis is generally preferred by corporate and commercial aircraft builders, as it also provides a wet look. Compared to epoxies, polyurethane has:  Faster cure time  Higher susceptibility to moisture during curing, Very high gloss retention, A very high abrasion resistance Acrylic urethane dries quickly to form a hard surface after coat application. It is less resistant to harsh chemicals and needs additional UV inhibitors for protection against the UV rays of sunlight. However, it provides a rugged and durable coating, as well as effective chip resistance, making equipment look new even in extremely harsh environments. Recent epoxy primers are also formulated as chrome hazard-free primers, having superior phosphate ester hydraulic fluid resistance (Skydrol resistance), as well as high corrosion resistance. These provide long wet edge, which is advantageous in coating a large aircraft. Epoxies produce hard, tough, and chemical-resistant layers when applied on a suitably primed substrate. They are better compared to polyurethanes in water resistance as well as adhesion. They are less susceptible to moisture during curing. Skin irritation can occur while handling epoxies, but they do not contain isocyanine. Solvent-free epoxies can be applied in thick films, but they have high moisture susceptibility during curing. These solvent-free epoxies have a short pot life and low color stability. Unlike solvent-based epoxies, which may shrink up to 70%, the solvent-free types do not suffer from film shrinkage. As they are softer than urethane, they have better chipping resistance. They are highly preferred for steel tube frames. Epoxy coatings are also used for coating propeller blades, providing abrasion resistance and corrosion protection. Zinc chromate is a pigment used in different formulations for corrosion resistance, which is added to primers of alkyds, polyurethanes, and epoxies. However, it is restricted by regulators as a carcinogenic substance. Proprietary photo-luminescent coating kits have been developed for military use, which makes the tips of propeller blades and helicopter rotors visible in low visibility conditions and night operation. The coating system improves visibility for the safety of people in hangers, repair stations, helipads and airstrips. A polyester-urethane combination coating has multiple advantages of high solids with multiple components, generally used as top gloss finishing coating in both military as well as commercial aviation. (Find the answer to the question: What do I need to consider when it comes to applying high solids coatings?) Individually, polyester coatings generally provide an exotic look with super high gloss needed for interiors, with scratch resistance and a glass-like clear film. On account of their exotic appearance, micas are now used widely for aircraft liveries. These are easily repaired and have the additional advantage of flexibility and adjustability of properties for different environmental conditions. After the aircraft frame and components are manufactured, they are essentially protected by coating with layers of corrosion-resistant alloys, ceramics and paints.After applying the top coat, the job is only half done, because the coating effectiveness needs to be monitored regularly and corrective and preventive actions are needed at regular intervals. The critical actions must include moisture prevention for all surfaces.Corrosive salt deposits need to be removed by a thorough cleaning (by rinse-clean processes).Delaminated or chipped surfaces need to be repaired early, after stripping, sanding and primer application if needed. The selection of an appropriate coating, based on the operational conditions of aircraft and the substrate compatibility, is important for ensuring the economic service life of the aircraft.",Aviation Coatings for Corrosion Prevention
